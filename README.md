# CS50 Computer Science (2021)
Before read this repository files, remember the [Academic Honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/honesty/).
<br/>
These files serve to give you a sense of how to do, iff, you feel lost in solving the problem.
<br/>
Don't copy and paste any of these files, try to solve any problems by yourself.
#### Some of these codes are not a good reference, because I made them when I started studying computer science, but I hope they are useful.
